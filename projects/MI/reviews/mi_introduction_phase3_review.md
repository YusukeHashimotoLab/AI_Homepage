- ✅ Mix of review papers and practical resources appropriate for beginners

**Critical Issues**:
1. **No inline citations in text**
   - Scientific claims lack [1], [2] style references
   - Reader cannot verify specific statements
   - Lines 42, 140, 238, 268, etc. need citation markers

2. **Missing DOI links**
   - Line 370: "Ramprasad, R., et al. (2017)" - needs full DOI
   - Line 372: "Butler, K. T., et al. (2018)" - needs full DOI
   - Should be: `https://doi.org/10.1038/...`

3. **Limited recency**

   - MI field has advanced significantly 2019-2024
   - Recommend adding 1-2 recent references (2022-2024)

4. **Missing author details**
   - "et al." used without full author lists or first author emphasis
   - For beginner readers, more complete citations would be educational

**Recommendations**:
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Add inline citations throughout text [1], [2], [3], etc.
- Add DOI links to all paper references
- Add 2-3 recent references (2020-2024):
  - Suggested: Recent Nature Materials or Science reviews on MI
  - Suggested: Recent case studies from 2023-2024
- Use complete author lists (at least first 3 authors) for educational value
