- **High experimental costs**: Several million yen per pilot plant experiment
- **Time-consuming**: 2-3 years to find optimal conditions
- **Difficult multi-variable optimization**: Simultaneous optimization of multiple parameters (temperature, pressure, catalyst amount, residence time)

As an example, a petrochemical manufacturer's propylene production process had a yield stagnating at 75%.

#### PI Approach

In a 2021 BASF case study, process optimization was achieved using the following methods:

1. **Historical data utilization**: Collected 10 years of process data (50,000 samples)

    # LSTM prediction
    predicted_trajectory = lstm_model.predict(current_state)

    # Optimization
    optimal_feed_rate = optimize_feeding(
        predicted_trajectory,
        constraints=[DO >= 30, pH_in_range]
    )

    # Execution
    set_feed_rate(optimal_feed_rate)

    # Model update (online learning)

- Low reproducibility in batch process, ±30% variation
- 50% particle size change during scale-up (10L → 1000L)

**PI Approach**:

1. **Data collection**:
   - Online particle size measurement with PAT (Process Analytical Technology) (FBRM: Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement)
   - Historical data of supersaturation, temperature, stirring speed, residence time (1,000 batches)

   - Input: Supersaturation history, temperature profile, stirring speed
   - Output: D50, D90 after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes

3. **Real-time optimization**:
   - Model Predictive Control (MPC) dynamically adjusts cooling rate
   - Constraints: Supersaturation < 1.5 (prevent nucleation explosion)
   - Objective: D50 = 100 μm, minimize CSD width

4. **Population Balance Model (PBM) integration**:
   - Physical model describing crystal nucleation, growth, agglomeration
   - Estimate PBM parameters (nucleation rate, growth rate constant) with machine learning

**Expected Results**:

**Quality improvement**:
- Particle size control accuracy: D50 = 100±30 μm → 100±5 μm (6× accuracy)
- CSD width: D90/D10 = 3.5 → 2.0 (more uniform crystals)
- Scale-up success rate: 50% → 90%

**Productivity improvement**:

### Problem 4 (Difficulty: hard)

From a sustainability DX perspective, design a PI project to reduce CO2 emissions in chemical processes. Include the following:
- Specific approaches to CO2 reduction
- How to handle tradeoffs between performance (yield, quality) and CO2 reduction
- Economic evaluation (considering carbon tax)

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer (Ammonia Synthesis Process Case)</summary>

**Project Name**: Multi-objective optimization of green ammonia synthesis

**Challenge**:
- Conventional Haber-Bosch process: 1.9 tons CO2 emission/ton-NH3 (accounts for 1% of global emissions)
- Large energy consumption at high temperature and pressure (450°C, 200 bar)
- Hydrogen source is fossil fuel (steam reforming of natural gas)

**CO2 Reduction Approach**:

1. **Green hydrogen utilization**:
   - Hydrogen production by water electrolysis (renewable energy derived)
   - CO2 emission: Fossil fuel derived 1.5 → 0.2 tons/ton-H2

2. **Reaction condition optimization**:
   - PI optimizes temperature and pressure to improve energy efficiency
   - Bayesian optimization maximizes catalyst activity (lower temperature/pressure)

3. **Process integration**:
   - Reaction heat recovery rate: 60% → 85% (heat exchange network optimization)
   - Unreacted gas recycling rate: 90% → 98%

**Multi-objective Optimization Settings**:

**Objective functions**:
- Objective 1: Minimize manufacturing cost (yen/ton-NH3)
- Objective 2: Minimize CO2 emissions (ton-CO2/ton-NH3)

**Variables**:
- Reaction temperature: 350-500°C
- Reaction pressure: 100-250 bar
- H2/N2 ratio: 2.5-3.5
- Catalyst type: Fe-based, Ru-based, Co-Mo-based

**Constraints**:
- Ammonia yield ≥ 15% (economic viability)
- Catalyst lifetime ≥ 2 years (replacement cost consideration)
- Safety: Pressure < 250 bar

**Handling Tradeoffs**:

Examples of Pareto optimal solutions:
| Case | Temp[°C] | Press[bar] | Yield[%] | CO2[ton/ton] | Cost[yen/ton] |
|------|----------|------------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| A (Conventional) | 450 | 200 | 18 | 1.9 | 50,000 |
| B (Low carbon) | 380 | 150 | 15 | 0.5 | 65,000 |
| C (Balanced) | 420 | 180 | 17 | 0.8 | 55,000 |

**Economic Evaluation (Considering Carbon Tax)**:

**Scenario 1: Carbon tax $50/ton-CO2**
- Case A: Manufacturing cost 50,000 + carbon tax 9,500 = 59,500 yen/ton
- Case B: Manufacturing cost 65,000 + carbon tax 2,500 = 67,500 yen/ton
- **Conclusion**: Case A advantageous (conventional process)

**Scenario 2: Carbon tax $100/ton-CO2**
- Case A: Manufacturing cost 50,000 + carbon tax 19,000 = 69,000 yen/ton
- Case B: Manufacturing cost 65,000 + carbon tax 5,000 = 70,000 yen/ton
- **Conclusion**: Almost equivalent, choose Case B for environmental value

**Scenario 3: Carbon tax $150/ton-CO2**
- Case A: Manufacturing cost 50,000 + carbon tax 28,500 = 78,500 yen/ton
- Case B: Manufacturing cost 65,000 + carbon tax 7,500 = 72,500 yen/ton
- **Conclusion**: Case B advantageous (low-carbon process)

**Expected Results**:
- CO2 reduction: 1.9 → 0.5 tons/ton-NH3 (approximately 73% reduction)
- Economically viable at carbon tax $100 or higher
- Addresses 2030 green ammonia market (5 million tons/year)
