<h2 id="11-history-of-materials-development-5000-years-of-trial-and-error">1.1 History of Materials Development: 5000 Years of Trial and Error</h2>
<p>Human civilization has always evolved alongside <strong>materials</strong>. The types and performance of materials we use have characterized each era.</p>
<h3 id="ancient-times-the-era-of-accidental-discovery">Ancient Times: The Era of Accidental Discovery</h3>
<p><strong>Bronze Age (circa 3000 BCE)</strong></p>
<p>Bronze, humanity's first alloy (an alloy of copper and tin), was probably an accidental product. It was smelted in a state where copper ore and tin ore were mixed, and by chance, a metal much harder than pure copper was obtained. This discovery led humanity to transition from the Stone Age to the Metal Age.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development method</strong>: Complete accident</li>
<li><strong>Development period</strong>: Several hundred years to discover the optimal composition ratio (approximately 90% copper, 10% tin)</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge accumulation</strong>: Only empirical rules passed down orally</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iron Age (circa 1200 BCE)</strong></p>
<p>With the establishment of iron smelting technology, harder materials that exist more abundantly became available. However, establishing techniques to control iron properties (quenching, tempering) took several more hundred years.</p>
<h3 id="modern-era-development-based-on-empirical-rules-1800-1950s">Modern Era: Development Based on Empirical Rules (1800-1950s)</h3>
<p><strong>Age of Steel (1800s)</strong></p>
<p>During the Industrial Revolution period, Henry Bessemer invented the Bessemer converter process (1856), enabling mass production of steel. However, this invention was also basically a product of <strong>trial and error</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development method</strong>: Trial and error through experimentation</li>
<li><strong>Development period</strong>: 5-10 years for one new material development</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge accumulation</strong>: Empirical rules and observation records</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery of Stainless Steel (1913)</strong></p>
<p>British metallurgist Harry Brearley was researching iron-chromium alloys aiming to improve the corrosion resistance of gun barrels. During experiments, he accidentally discovered steel that doesn't rust (stainless steel). This discovery was also basically through <strong>accident and empirical rules</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-era-beginning-of-theory-based-design-1950s-present">Contemporary Era: Beginning of Theory-Based Design (1950s-Present)</h3>
<p><strong>Silicon Semiconductors (1950s)</strong></p>
<p>With the establishment of transistor technology (invented in 1947) and silicon semiconductor technology, the foundation of the information society was built. Around this time, materials design based on <strong>theoretical foundations</strong> such as quantum mechanics began.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development method</strong>: Theory-based design + experimental validation</li>
<li><strong>Development period</strong>: 10-20 years for one new material development</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge accumulation</strong>: Scientific papers, patents, databases</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polymer Materials and Composite Materials (1990s onwards)</strong></p>
<p>Composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) came to be adopted in aircraft and automobiles. These materials are designed utilizing theoretical calculations and simulations. However, <strong>experimental validation</strong> is still essential in the end.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-visible-from-history">Challenges Visible from History</h3>
<p>Looking back at 5000 years of materials development history, the following challenges become visible:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dependence on accident</strong>: Many important discoveries were products of chance</li>
<li><strong>Time-consuming process</strong>: Several years to several decades for one material development</li>
<li><strong>Limited exploration range</strong>: Only exploring the range researchers can think of</li>
<li><strong>Dispersed knowledge</strong>: Knowledge dispersed among individuals and organizations, making systematic accumulation difficult</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question: What if we could systematically explore materials by computer?</strong></p>
<p>This is the starting point of <strong>Materials Informatics (MI)</strong>, the next generation of materials development methods.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="12-limitations-of-conventional-materials-development">1.2 Limitations of Conventional Materials Development</h2>
<p>Modern materials development has become far more advanced than ancient times. However, it still faces major challenges.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-1-time-consuming">Challenge 1: Time-consuming</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Materials Development Timeline</strong></p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>Years 1-2: Literature survey and theoretical examination
  ↓
Years 3-5: Synthesis and evaluation of candidate materials (10-50 types)
  ↓
Years 6-10: Optimization and characterization
  ↓
Years 11-15: Establishment of mass synthesis process for practical application
  ↓
Years 16-20: Practical application and commercialization
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result</strong>: It takes <strong>an average of 15-20 years</strong> from new material to practical application[1,2].</p>
<h3 id="challenge-2-high-cost">Challenge 2: High cost</h3>
<p><strong>Cost to evaluate one material</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material synthesis</strong>: 100,000-1,000,000 yen (reagents, equipment usage fees)</li>
<li><strong>Characterization</strong>: 500,000-5,000,000 yen (measurement equipment usage fees, analysis costs)</li>
<li><strong>Personnel costs</strong>: 1 researcher × 1-2 weeks = 500,000-1,000,000 yen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total</strong>: <strong>1-7 million yen per material</strong></p>
<p>A laboratory with an annual budget of 30 million yen can only evaluate <strong>10-30 materials per year</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-3-limited-exploration-range">Challenge 3: Limited exploration range</h3>
<p><strong>Material combinations are astronomical numbers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Elements in periodic table: About 90 types (practical elements)</li>
<li>Binary alloy combinations: About 4,000 patterns</li>
<li>Ternary alloy combinations: About 117,000 patterns</li>
<li>Quaternary alloy combinations: About 2.9 million patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, considering variations in composition ratios and crystal structures, there are <strong>essentially infinite combinations</strong>.</p>
<p>With conventional methods, based on <strong>researcher experience and intuition</strong>, they select and experiment with tens to hundreds of types. In other words, only <strong>a small fraction</strong> of the vast possibilities can be explored.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-4-dependence-on-experience-and-intuition">Challenge 4: Dependence on experience and intuition</h3>
<p><strong>Tacit knowledge of experienced researchers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"This combination of elements tends to become unstable"</li>
<li>"This crystal structure is advantageous for ion conduction"</li>
<li>"Sintering at this temperature produces good properties"</li>
</ul>
<p>Such <strong>tacit knowledge</strong> is very valuable, but has the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Difficult to systematize</strong>: Hard to share because based on individual experience</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility issues</strong>: Results may differ among researchers even under same conditions</li>
<li><strong>Time for training young researchers</strong>: 10+ years of experience needed to become proficient</li>
<li><strong>Existence of bias</strong>: May miss innovative discoveries by being bound to existing knowledge</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="13-case-study-20-years-of-lithium-ion-battery-development">1.3 Case Study: 20 Years of Lithium-Ion Battery Development</h2>
<p>The development story of lithium-ion batteries is a typical example showing <strong>the difficulty of conventional materials development</strong> and <strong>the importance of persistent research</strong>. Let's look closely at this technology, which was the subject of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-basic-research-1970s">Phase 1: Basic Research (1970s)</h3>
<p><strong>Background: Energy Crisis</strong></p>
<p>The oil shock of the 1970s heightened interest in energy storage technology not dependent on petroleum.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. John Goodenough's Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Goodenough at Oxford University believed that oxide materials containing lithium were promising for energy storage.</p>
<p><strong>Material candidates explored</strong>: About 100+ types</p>
<ul>
<li>LiMO₂ (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)</li>
<li>LiM₂O₄ (M = Mn, Co)</li>
<li>Various crystal structures (layered, spinel, olivine)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery (1980)</strong>: <strong>LiCoO₂ (Lithium cobalt oxide)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Features: Layered structure, Li ions can move between layers</li>
<li>Theoretical capacity: 274 mAh/g</li>
<li>Operating voltage: About 4V (high voltage for the time)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there were still <strong>many challenges</strong> to put this material into practical use.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-development-of-negative-electrode-material-1980s">Phase 2: Development of Negative Electrode Material (1980s)</h3>
<p><strong>Challenge: Danger of metallic lithium</strong></p>
<p>Initially, metallic lithium was used for the negative electrode, but there were the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dendrite formation</strong>: With repeated charging and discharging, needle-like lithium crystals (dendrites) grow</li>
<li><strong>Short circuit risk</strong>: When dendrites reach the positive electrode, they short circuit and risk ignition</li>
<li><strong>Cycle life</strong>: Degradation after tens of charge-discharge cycles</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dr. Akira Yoshino's Solution (1985)</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Yoshino at Asahi Kasei conceived the idea of using <strong>carbon material (graphite)</strong> as a lithium-ion storage material.</p>
<p><strong>Material candidates explored</strong>: About 50+ types</p>
<ul>
<li>Various graphite materials</li>
<li>Amorphous carbon</li>
<li>Graphite intercalation compounds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results</strong>:<br />
- Graphite safely stores Li ions between layers<br />
- No dendrite formation<br />
- Cycle life improved to hundreds of times</p>
<h3 id="phase-3-electrolyte-optimization-late-1980s">Phase 3: Electrolyte Optimization (Late 1980s)</h3>
<p><strong>Challenge: Electrolyte stability</strong></p>
<p>An electrolyte that operates stably between the positive electrode (4V) and negative electrode (0V vs Li/Li⁺) was needed.</p>
<p><strong>Material candidates explored</strong>: About 100+ types</p>
<ul>
<li>Combinations of various organic solvents</li>
<li>Lithium salts (LiPF₆, LiBF₄, LiClO₄, etc.)</li>
<li>Additives (controlling SEI film formation)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery of optimal solution</strong>:<br />
- Ethylene carbonate (EC) + Diethyl carbonate (DEC)<br />
- Lithium salt: LiPF₆<br />
- This combination achieved stable charging and discharging</p>
<h3 id="phase-4-practical-application-1991">Phase 4: Practical Application (1991)</h3>
<p><strong>Commercialization by Sony</strong></p>
<p>In 1991, Sony commercialized the world's first lithium-ion battery as a battery for video cameras.</p>

<p><strong>Total number of materials explored</strong>: Estimated <strong>500+ types</strong></p>
<p><strong>Failed experiments</strong>: Thousands or more</p>
<p><strong>Question: What if MI existed?</strong></p>
<p>If modern MI technology existed in the 1970s:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Narrowing down material candidates</strong>: Machine learning predicts 100 promising types in a few days</li>
<li><strong>Electrolyte optimization</strong>: Bayesian optimization discovers optimal composition in about 20 experiments</li>
<li><strong>Development period</strong>: Estimated <strong>5-7 years</strong> (less than 1/3) reduction possible</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not science fiction but what is <strong>actually possible</strong> with modern MI technology.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-difficulty-easy">Problem 1 (Difficulty: easy)</h3>
<p>In the history of materials development, explain how development methods evolved across three eras: Bronze Age, Iron Age, and modern era.</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Think about the flow from accident → trial and error → theory-based design.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer</summary>

**Bronze Age (circa 3000 BCE)**:
- Development method: Complete accident
- Alloy accidentally formed when copper ore and tin ore were mixed
- Several hundred years to discover optimal composition

**Iron Age (circa 1200 BCE)**:
- Development method: Trial and error and empirical rules
- Experimentally discovered heat treatments like quenching and tempering
- Knowledge accumulated as empirical rules

**Modern Era (1950s onwards)**:
- Development method: Theory-based design + experimental validation
- Utilizing theories like quantum mechanics and thermodynamics
- Combination of simulation and experimentation
- However, still takes 10-20 years for development

</details>

<h3 id="problem-2-difficulty-easy">Problem 2 (Difficulty: easy)</h3>
<p>Calculate how long it takes to evaluate 100 materials per year with conventional materials development methods. Assume it takes 4 weeks per material.</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

1 material × 4 weeks = 100 materials × ? weeks

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer</summary>

**Calculation**:
- 1 material × 4 weeks = 100 materials × 4 weeks = 400 weeks
- 1 year = 52 weeks
- 400 weeks ÷ 52 weeks/year = **about 7.7 years**

**Conclusion**: It takes about 8 years to evaluate 100 materials with conventional methods. This is one reason why conventional methods can only explore a limited number of materials.

</details>

<h3 id="problem-3-difficulty-medium">Problem 3 (Difficulty: medium)</h3>
<p>In the development of lithium-ion batteries, if MI technology had existed in the 1970s, how would the development process have changed? Explain specifically.</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Think about the exploration processes for the three components: positive electrode material, negative electrode material, and electrolyte.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer</summary>

**Exploration of positive electrode material (discovery of LiCoO₂)**:

Conventional method (actual history):
- Trial and error with 100+ candidates over 10 years
- Discovered LiCoO₂ in 1980

MI method (hypothetical scenario):
- Analyze existing oxide data (thousands of types) with machine learning
- Predict electrochemical stability and ion conductivity
- Experimentally validate top 10 promising types in 2-3 years
- Early discovery of multiple candidates including LiCoO₂

**Exploration of negative electrode material (graphite)**:

Conventional method:
- Trial and error with 50+ types of carbon materials
- Graphite found promising in 1985

MI method:
- Predict Li insertion energy with first-principles calculations
- Screen layered structure materials
- Identify promising candidates including graphite within 1 year

**Electrolyte optimization**:

Conventional method:
- Trial and error with 100+ combinations of solvents and salts
- Several years to discover optimal composition (EC/DEC + LiPF₆)

MI method:
- Efficiently narrow down search space with Bayesian optimization
- Identify optimal composition in 20-30 experiments
- Develop practical electrolyte within 1 year

**Overall development period**:
- Conventional method: About 20 years (1970s-1991)
- MI method: Estimated 5-7 years (60-70% reduction)

**Additional benefits**:
- Could have discovered other promising positive electrode materials (LiMn₂O₄, LiFePO₄, etc.) early
- Further improvement in battery performance
- Selection of safer materials
