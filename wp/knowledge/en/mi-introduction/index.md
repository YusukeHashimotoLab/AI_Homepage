## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q1: Can programming beginners understand this?

**A**: Chapters 1 and 2 are theory-focused and require no programming experience. Chapter 3 assumes understanding of Python basics (variables, functions, lists), but code examples are thoroughly commented for beginners. If unsure, we recommend learning basics with [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) before Chapter 3.

### Q2: Which chapter should I start from?

**A**: **First-time learners are strongly recommended to read from Chapter 1 in order.** Each chapter is independent, but concepts build progressively. Python-experienced learners with limited time may start from Chapter 2.

### Q3: Do I need to actually run the code?

**A**: To maximize Chapter 3 learning, **running code is strongly recommended.** Understanding differs significantly between reading and executing. If environment setup is difficult, start with Google Colab (free, no installation).

### Q4: How long does it take to master?

**A**: Depends on learning time and goals:
- **Concept understanding only**: 1-2 days (Chapters 1-2)
- **Basic implementation skills**: 1-2 weeks (Chapters 1-3)
- **Practical project execution**: 2-4 weeks (All 4 chapters + project challenge)
- **Professional-level skills**: 3-6 months (Series completion + additional projects)

### Q5: Can I become an MI expert with just this series?

**A**: This series targets "introductory to intermediate" level. To reach expert level:
1. Build foundation with this series (2-4 weeks)
2. Learn advanced content from Chapter 4 resources (3-6 months)
3. Execute original projects (6-12 months)
4. Conference presentations and paper writing (1-2 years)

Continuous learning and practice for 2-3 years is necessary.
