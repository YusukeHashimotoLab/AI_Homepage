## 2. Five Success Stories

### 2.1 Case Study 1: Lithium-Ion Battery Materials Discovery

#### Challenge

Lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and electric vehicles require higher **energy density** (capacity) and **longer lifespan** (cycle characteristics). While conventional cathode materials (LiCoO2) have a theoretical capacity of 274 mAh/g, materials with even higher capacity are needed.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1 (Difficulty: easy)

Choose one of the five case studies introduced in this chapter and explain:
- What challenges existed
- How MI was utilized
- What results were obtained

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider Case Study 2 (catalyst materials) as an example. There was a clear challenge of finding alternative materials for platinum.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer (for catalyst materials)</summary>

**Challenge**:
Catalysts used in hydrogen production and fuel cells require platinum (Pt), but it is expensive (approximately 4,000 yen/g) and rare, so low-cost, high-activity alternative catalysts are needed.

**MI Utilization**:
- Predicted hydrogen adsorption energy using first-principles calculations (DFT)
- Efficiently selected next experimental candidates using Bayesian optimization
- Discovered optimal composition in 10-20 experiments

**Results**:
- Mo-Co-N system: 50% reduction in Pt usage, 120% activity
- Development time: 2 years → 3 months (approximately 8x faster)
- Cost reduction: 80% reduction in catalyst price (1,000,000 yen/kg → 200,000 yen/kg)

</details>

### Problem 2 (Difficulty: medium)

Compare self-driving labs with conventional human-led laboratories and list three advantages and disadvantages for each.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider perspectives of speed, cost, and creativity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer</summary>

**Advantages of Self-Driving Labs**:
1. **24-hour operation**: No human working hour constraints, experiments continue on holidays
2. **High speed**: Synthesize and evaluate 41 materials in 17 days (approximately 10x human speed)
3. **Reproducibility**: Minimize experimental error through precise robot control

**Disadvantages of Self-Driving Labs**:
1. **High initial investment**: Approximately 100 million yen equipment introduction cost
2. **Low flexibility**: Automation of complex synthesis procedures (high-temperature processing, etc.) is difficult
3. **Lack of creativity**: Difficult to achieve human intuitive discoveries

**Advantages of Conventional Laboratories**:
1. **Flexibility**: Can respond immediately to unexpected results
2. **Creativity**: Can try new ideas based on human intuition
3. **Low initial cost**: Utilize existing equipment and personnel

**Disadvantages of Conventional Laboratories**:
1. **Working hour constraints**: Only operate 8 hours per day, 5 days per week
2. **Reproducibility issues**: Errors due to experimenters occur easily
3. **Low throughput**: Can only evaluate 10-100 types of materials per year

- Problem statement
- MI approach (methods to use)
- Expected outcomes

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Apply the case studies from this chapter to your field of interest.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Answer (for semiconductor materials)</summary>

**Field**: Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO)

**Challenge**:

**MI Approach**:
1. **Data collection**: Obtain bandgap and electrical conductivity data for 100,000 oxide materials from Materials Project
2. **Build prediction model**: Use Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict:
   - Bandgap (transparency indicator: 3.0-3.5 eV optimal)
   - Carrier concentration (conductivity indicator)
3. **Screening**: 100,000 types → Narrow to 100 types that achieve both transparency and conductivity
4. **Multi-objective optimization**: Also consider cost (avoid rare elements)
5. **Experimental validation**: Synthesize and measure top 10 types

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Discovery of indium-free TCO (e.g., Sn-Zn-O system)
- 50% material cost reduction
- Development time: 5 years → 1 year (80% reduction)
- Contribution to touchpanel market (annual market scale approximately 5 trillion yen)

**Reasoning**:

**1. Salary and Economic Rewards**:
- Higher salary than academia (7-10 million yen vs. 5-7 million yen annually)
- Stable employment (for large companies)
- Economic stability important for supporting family

**2. Research Freedom**:
- Topics align with company business strategy, but MI field is broad enough to be acceptable
- Short-term results required, but that becomes my motivation

**3. Social Impact**:
- Large direct impact on society as products reach market
- Example: Battery material improvement → EV adoption → CO2 reduction
- Attracted to "visible form" of contribution compared to academic papers

**4. Lifestyle**:
- Want to avoid long working hours like academia (nighttime/weekend research)
- Value work-life balance (time with family)
- Industry has (depending on company) relatively stable schedule

**5. Personal Values**:
- More interested in "solving social issues" than "research for research's sake"
- Value team achievements over academic competition (paper count, citations)
- Want achievement of "products I was involved with being used worldwide" in 10 years

**Conclusion**:
Want to contribute to practical materials development while living a stable life as MI Engineer in industry. However, keeping startup career change as future option while continuing to learn latest technologies.

- Biodegradable plastics (PLA, PHA) have low performance (strength, heat resistance)

**Environmental Impact Metrics**:
1. **CO2 emissions**: Carbon footprint during manufacturing (kg-CO2/kg)
   - Conventional PE: Approximately 2.0 kg-CO2/kg
   - Target: < 1.0 kg-CO2/kg
2. **Biodegradability**: Degradation rate after 6 months (%)
   - Conventional PE: < 5%
   - Target: > 90%

3. **Constraints**:
   - Exclude toxic substances (phthalates, BPA, etc.)
   - Do not use rare elements
4. **Experimental validation**:
   - Select 10 types from Pareto optimal solutions
   - Synthesis, measurement, LCA evaluation

**Handling Tradeoffs**:
