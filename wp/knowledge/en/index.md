### Q7: How independent are the series?

**A**: **Each series can be studied independently**, but some common concepts exist:

**Common concepts** (appear in all series):
- Machine learning basics (regression, classification, optimization)
- Basic Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering
- Model evaluation (MAE, R², cross-validation)

**Series-specific concepts**:
- **MI**: Material descriptors, Materials Project API, crystal structures
- **NM**: Size effects, quantum confinement, nanoparticle synthesis
- **PI**: Process parameters, time series analysis, multi-objective optimization
- **MLP**: Potential energy surfaces, DFT, symmetry functions, graph neural networks

**Interrelationships**:
```
MI (Foundation) → NM (Application 1)
                → PI (Application 2)
