## Practice Problems

### Problem 1 (Difficulty: medium)

Case Study 1 (Cu CO₂ reduction catalyst) and Case Study 2 (Li battery electrolyte) use different MLP methods (SchNet vs DeepMD). Explain from the perspective of system characteristics (atom count, periodicity, dynamics) why appropriate methods were selected for each system.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Focus on the differences: catalysis is surface (non-periodic) while electrolyte is liquid (large-scale system).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example Answer</summary>

**Why SchNet is Suitable for Cu Catalysis**:

1. **System Characteristics**:
   - Surface adsorption (non-periodic, local interactions important)
   - Atom count: ~200 (medium-scale systems SchNet excels at)
   - Chemical reactions: Bond formation/breaking (high-accuracy energy/forces needed)

2. **SchNet Strengths**:
   - Continuous-filter convolution → Learns smooth distance dependence
   - Message passing → Accurately captures local chemical environment
   - Accuracy: Energy MAE 8 meV/atom (sufficient for chemical reactions)

**Why DeepMD is Suitable for Li Electrolyte**:

1. **System Characteristics**:
   - Liquid (periodic boundary conditions, long-range interactions)
   - Atom count: 500-1,000 (large-scale system)
   - Dynamics: Ion diffusion (long-timescale MD needed, computational speed prioritized)

2. **DeepMD Strengths**:
   - Linear scaling O(N) → Fast for large-scale systems
   - Optimization for periodic boundary conditions (built-in functionality)
   - LAMMPS integration → Easy large-scale parallel MD
   - Accuracy: Energy RMSE 12 meV/atom (sufficient for property prediction)

**Comparison Table**:

| Characteristic | Cu Catalyst (SchNet) | Li Electrolyte (DeepMD) |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| System Size | 200 atoms (medium) | 500-1,000 atoms (large) |
| Periodicity | Non-periodic (surface slab) | Periodic (liquid cell) |
| Computational Scaling | O(N²) (implementation-dependent) | O(N) (optimized) |
| Accuracy Priority | Chemical reactions (ultra-high) | Diffusion coefficient (moderate) |
| Computational Speed | Moderate | Fast (parallelized) |

**Conclusion**: Important to select optimal MLP method according to system characteristics (size, periodicity, purpose). SchNet suits accuracy-focused medium-scale systems, DeepMD suits speed-focused large-scale systems.

### Problem 2 (Difficulty: hard)

Foundation Models for Chemistry (Trend 1) are predicted to replace 80% of DFT calculations by 2030. What cases would still require the remaining 20% of DFT calculations? Provide 3 specific examples with explanations.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider outside Foundation Models' training data range, extreme conditions, new phenomenon discovery.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example Answer</summary>

**Cases Where DFT Calculations Still Necessary (3 cases)**:

**Case 1: Novel Systems Outside Training Data Range**

- **Specific Example**: Compounds containing new elements (e.g., superheavy elements, Og (Oganesson)-containing molecules)
- **Reason**:
  - Elements not included in Foundation Models' training data
  - Extrapolation (prediction beyond learning range) significantly reduces accuracy
  - Need to generate new data with DFT → Retrain Foundation Model
- **Proportion**: ~5% of all calculations (new element research is limited)

**Case 2: Calculations Under Extreme Conditions**

- **Specific Examples**:
  - Ultra-high pressure (100 GPa+, Earth's deep interior, planetary interiors)
  - Ultra-high temperature (10,000 K+, plasma state)
  - Strong magnetic fields (100 Tesla+, neutron star surfaces)
- **Reason**:
  - Foundation Models trained on standard conditions data (ambient temperature/pressure, weak magnetic fields)
  - Electronic structure changes dramatically under extreme conditions (metallization, ionization, etc.)
  - Even difficult with DFT, but first-principles calculation is only means
- **Proportion**: ~10% of all calculations (earth/planetary science, high-energy physics)

**Case 3: New Phenomenon Discovery & Fundamental Physics Research**

- **Specific Examples**:
  - Elucidating new superconductivity mechanisms (room-temperature superconductivity, etc.)
  - Exotic electronic states (topological insulators, quantum spin liquids)
  - Unknown chemical reaction mechanisms
- **Reason**:
  - Foundation Models learn from known data → Cannot predict unknown phenomena
  - Discovering new phenomena requires calculation from quantum mechanics fundamentals (DFT)
  - Nobel Prize-level discoveries come from DFT (e.g., graphene electronic states, 2010 Nobel Prize)
- **Proportion**: ~5% of all calculations (basic research, Nobel Prize-level discoveries)

**Summary Table**:

| Case | Specific Example | Proportion | Reason |
|------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Novel Systems | Superheavy element compounds | 5% | Outside training data range |
| Extreme Conditions | Ultra-high pressure/temperature/strong fields | 10% | Dramatic electronic structure changes |
| New Phenomenon Discovery | Room-temp superconductivity, new reactions | 5% | Unknown→unpredictable from known data |
| **Total** | - | **20%** | **DFT Essential Domain** |

**Conclusion**: Foundation Models are extremely powerful within known ranges, but DFT remains essential for science frontiers (unknown discoveries). Coexistence of both will continue beyond 2030.

</details>

### Problem 3 (Difficulty: hard)

Suppose you are a 2nd-year Master's student choosing between 3 career paths (academic research, industrial R&D, startup). Considering the following conditions, select the most suitable path and explain your reasoning.

**Conditions**:
- Research theme: CO₂ reduction catalysis (interested in both fundamental research and industrial applications)
- Personality: Moderate risk tolerance, want to avoid long work hours, prioritize salary stability
- Goal: Recognized as domain expert in 10 years
- Family: Marriage planned (within 5 years), want children

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Compare each path's risk, salary, work-life balance, and career certainty.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example Answer</summary>

**Recommended Path: Industrial R&D (Research position at chemical company)**

**Reasoning**:

**1. Risk and Stability Perspective**:
- **Academic Research**:
  - Risk: **High** (many term-limited positions, 15 years to professorship, possibility of dropping out)
  - Stability: Stable upon professorship, but 30-40% success probability
- **Industrial R&D**:
  - Risk: **Low** (permanent employment, employment stability)
  - Stability: Can work until retirement (age 60-65)
- **Startup**:
  - Risk: **Extremely High** (10% success rate, need to change jobs upon failure)
  - Stability: Unstable until IPO/acquisition (5-10 years)

→ **Industrial R&D optimal for your "moderate risk tolerance, stability priority"**

**2. Salary and Life Planning**:
- **Academic**:
  - 30s: ¥4-7M (postdoc~assistant professor)
  - 40s: ¥7-10M (associate professor)
  - **Problem**: Low salary during marriage/childbirth period (30s)
- **Industry**:
  - 30s: ¥7-10M (5-10 years experience)
  - 40s: ¥10-15M (senior)
  - **Advantage**: Sufficient income during marriage/child-rearing period
- **Startup**:
  - 30s: ¥5-8M (low until success)
  - On success: Hundreds of millions possible
  - **Problem**: Uncertainty for marriage within 5 years

→ **Industrial R&D enables stable income for family planning**

**3. Work-Life Balance**:
- **Academic**:
  - Flexibility: High (self-manage research time)
  - Long hours: 60-80 hours/week before paper deadlines
  - Family time: Relatively easy to secure
- **Industry**:
  - Flexibility: Medium (flexible work systems available)
  - Long hours: Usually 40-50 hours/week (60 hours during busy periods)
  - Family time: **Easy to secure** (weekends off, paid leave available)
- **Startup**:
  - Long hours: 60-80 hours/week (normalized)
  - Family time: **Difficult to secure**

→ **Industrial R&D optimal for "want to avoid long work hours"**

**4. Expert Recognition Possibility**:
- **Academic**:
  - Top journal papers → High recognition
  - But fierce competition (paper count competition)
- **Industry**:
  - In-house expert recognition: Easy (achievable in 10 years)
  - Conference presentations/patents → Industry recognition increase
  - **Possible**: Establish as "CO₂ catalysis industrial expert" in 10 years
- **Startup**:
  - Extremely high recognition on success (IPO, acquisition news)
  - Low recognition on failure

→ **Industrial R&D enables becoming expert with certainty**

**5. Research Theme (CO₂ Catalysis) Compatibility**:
- CO₂ reduction catalysis is **extremely high industrial demand** field
- Active R&D at companies (Mitsubishi Chemical, Sumitomo Chemical, etc.)
- Can engage in both fundamental research and application development (industrial R&D strength)

**Specific Career Plan (Industrial R&D)**:

```
Current (Master's 2nd year, age 26)
  ↓ Job hunting (chemical company, catalysis division)
2025 (age 27): Join company (salary ¥6M)
  - Assigned to CO₂ catalyst project
  - Deploy MLP technology in-house, internal training instructor
  ↓
2028 (age 30): Marriage, promotion to chief researcher (salary ¥8M)
  - Project lead (budget ¥50M)
  - 3 conference presentations, 5 patent applications
  ↓
2032 (age 34): Childbirth, senior researcher (salary ¥11M)
  - Keynote speech at internal technical symposium
  - Industry-academia collaboration project launch
  ↓
2035 (age 38): Group leader (salary ¥14M)
  - **Recognized in industry as "CO₂ catalysis expert"**
  - International conference invited talks, 15 papers, 20 patents
```

**Conclusion**: Industrial R&D satisfies all your conditions (moderate risk, stable income, work-life balance, 10-year expert). Academic research unstable, startup risk too high. Build career reliably in industrial R&D while balancing family and research.
